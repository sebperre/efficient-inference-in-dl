# Efficient Inference in Deep Learning

This is an honours project for CSC 499.

## Objectives Completed

1. Learned PyTorch
2. Looked at VGGs, ResNet, CNNs and how we can use them on datasets like CIFAR-10 and ImageNet
3. Tested Computer Specs for Deep Learning
4. Recreated VGGs for ResNet and ImageNet
5. Compared different models to see if it is possible to have a combined model
6. Created a Machine Learning pipeline for better training speed
